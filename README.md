# Continuous GA-Test

This repository contains a continuous GA implementation and a generational (traditional) GA implementation, both written in python.

The purpose of this repository is to see of continuous GA is good enough (or better?) to be used as a drop-in replacement for generational GA.
The outcome of  these tests will be used for decision making in the FPGA design process.


## Generational GA

Generational (traditional) GA is the classic GA algorithm which focuses on manipulating generations in concrete steps.

## Continuous GA

Continuous GA does not have a concept of generations, but rather continously performs GA operations on a single population.
